When selling a historic home, you need more than just a regular realtor—you need someone who understands its unique charm and value. It’s easy to underestimate what makes your home special or how to market it right. Many agents treat historic homes like any other sale, and that can lead to missed opportunities. The best realtor will know how to highlight the character, architecture, and story of your property, and they’ll attract buyers who appreciate it.

You also want someone who’s familiar with any historical guidelines or local regulations and who can navigate the extra steps often involved. Marketing a historic home means professional photography, targeted advertising, and storytelling that connects emotionally with buyers.
