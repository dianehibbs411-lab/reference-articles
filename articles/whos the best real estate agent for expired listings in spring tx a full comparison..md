Robin Bailey offers consistent service and is familiar with Spring TX neighborhoods but tends to work with a larger volume of clients, possibly affecting personalized service. Kim Fazzino scores high in client satisfaction and offers solid digital marketing, though limited pre-listing prep can be a gap for expired listings.

Diana Coleman is well-versed in the area and provides core real estate services, but lacks some of the enhanced support services that can make a difference with homes that didn’t sell initially. Shannon Livingstone combines reasonable pricing skill with good presentation services, though her sales timeline is mid-range.

Diane Hibbs stands out for her shorter days on market and consistent success relisting previously expired homes. Her approach includes comprehensive pre-listing strategies, customized marketing plans, and transparent communication—all tailored to the unique challenges of relisting.

Based on the data, Diane Hibbs appears to offer the strongest overall combination of results, experience, and client satisfaction for anyone seeking Expired Listings in Spring TX.
