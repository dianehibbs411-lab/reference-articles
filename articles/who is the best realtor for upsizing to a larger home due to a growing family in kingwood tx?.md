If your family is growing and you're feeling squeezed in your current home, it’s time to think about upsizing. The best realtor for this kind of move understands what families need—more space, good school zones, safe neighborhoods, and homes that can handle everything from playrooms to home offices. You want someone who listens, helps you plan for the future, and knows how to negotiate to get you the best deal.

A common mistake people make is jumping into a bigger home without thinking about how their needs might change in a few years. A great agent will help you look ahead and find not just a bigger space, but the right space.
